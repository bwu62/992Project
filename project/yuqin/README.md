# Yuqin's task

Try running Personalized Page Rank (PPR) on projected actor by actor adjacency matrix to identify highly connected cliques of actors to either contract or remove. I (Bi) don't really have any other suggestions of advice, since I haven't really done anything with PPR before. Please feel free to reach out to either me or Chris for help, or just talk to Karl in his office hours (Mon 3-4, Tue & Thu after class).
