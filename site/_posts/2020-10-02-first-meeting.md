## Main ideas

Download [IMDB dataset](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) (with [description here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)), and explore it. Ideas for things to try:

 - Find graph center (is it really Kevin Bacon?)
 - (KARL DISAPPROVES) Find graph diameter (two people who are farthest apart)
 - Find largest k-core (largest group of people all interconnected)
 - Cluster movies into genres only by using cast information using [vsp](https://github.com/RoheLab/vsp/)
 - Look at pagerank
