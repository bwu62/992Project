# Background

## Data description

 - Title & cast data from [IMDB database](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
 - Focus on **mainstream movies**
   - removed: TV series, shorts, adult content
   - subsetted largest connected component
 - Incidence matrix
   - $\sim\!463\text{K}\!\times\!607\text{K}$ &nbsp; ($\text{titles}\!\times\!\text{actors}$)
   - $\sim\!99.999\%$ sparsity
 - Additional attributes:
   - title/actor names
   - country/language info (scraped)

## Previous work

 - Node centrality analysis (see [blog](https://bwu62.github.io/992Project/#centrality))
 - Factor analysis with [`VSP`](https://github.com/RoheLab/vsp)
   - Goal:
     - Group films by **genre** based on cast
   - Result:
     - Grouped by **country/language** instead
 - Retried with English-only titles
   - Clusters have strange **cliques**

## Cliques
